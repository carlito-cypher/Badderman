			<p>The vehicle production is an important force to push automotive industry forward. With the growth of vehicle production and consumer electronics, vehicle electronics become a recently highlighted topic in the automotive industry and need more trained engineers. These engineers need both vehicle and electronic knowledge, and require hands-on experiences of embedded system. For this they need a solid basic research background, applied R&D basis, innovation of marketable products and services. However, the curricula of vehicle electronics have not kept pace with the demands for vehicle electronic engineers, especially OBD engineers. The practical training of OBD implementation based on embedded system is often insufficient for vehicle engineering students. Over the past few years we have been engaging in the study of student learning on embedded processors since MOE Subsidy Operational Guidelines for Advance System on Chip. This idea came from a teaching request, which is a material of experiments in an embedded system course needed by one of authors. We developed a material of embedded system applied on vehicle electronics. The vehicle electronics course is difficult to be developed, because the knowledge of it is related to electric circuit, sensors, hardware, and embedded software. 
To minimize the gap between theory and practical implementation, this study designed a practical implementation course by integrating discipline-specific components. In this study we have developed an OBD implementation courses that consist of OBD concept, interpreter circuit, and embedded system. The course provides students trainings on the OBD design and comprehensive hands-on practices on embedded system. The experiments of this course require students to build and analyze embedded systems, and ask students to combine various components from different concepts. The educational objectives are as follows: 
 Experience a variety of learning styles. 
• Have professional skills in electrical, circuit, and embedded system. 
• Encourage students to make connections between several components. 
• Have students actively learn the skills of efficient and accurate experimentation. 
• Improve student retention of experimental skills and facility with hardware. 
• Present material in a systems and applications context to better emulate industrial practice. 
Our concern to improve student learning through a practical implementation and to help students engage them in a deeper way. We examined different aspects of OBD implementation learning on graduate students in vehicle engineering. We began to learn what was important or not in vehicle electronics. The main problem is that as students graduated and then their learning was gone together. The solution was to develop a course on multi-disciplinary design using the OBD implementation based on embedded system as an 
example. 
In addition to experimenting with embedded OBD systems, we encourage students for themselves to learn it for life. Students take responsibility for learning and choose the appropriate solution from their implementation experience to solve a problem. They realize that the perfect or ultimate solution does not exist but they are asked to improve the system continually. Given a simulated industrial problem with a set of reference information, students design their systems to solve this problem. To reach this goal, we compared our requirements with Kolb's learning cycle1: concrete experience (experiencing), reflective observation (examining), abstract conceptualization (explaining), and active experimentation (applying). 
Therefore, we designed a learning environment that requires students to use all of the styles. At the beginning, students read the given problem and search the related references. Before developing OBD implementation, students read the manufacturer datasheets and instrument descriptions from this course. They should complete a term report including</p>
